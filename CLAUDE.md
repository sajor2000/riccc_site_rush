## Contact
- Public lab email: info@riccc-lab.com

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- Vercel hosting with Analytics + Speed Insights
- Staff admin panel at /staff/ (passphrase-protected, commits to GitHub via API)
- PubMed E-utilities API for publications (author-name search)
- Content stored as MDX/JSON files in content/ directory

## Staff Admin Panel
- Login: /staff/login (shared passphrase, 8-hour session)
- Manage team members: /staff/members (add, edit, archive, upload photos)
- All edits commit directly to GitHub repo via Octokit + GITHUB_BOT_TOKEN
- Team members: content/team/*.mdx
- Research spotlights: content/spotlights.json (edit JSON directly or via code)
- Site config: content/site-config.json (edit JSON directly or via code)
- Photos: public/images/team/ as WebP (1024×1024; staff upload or `npm run optimize:team-photos`). Pipeline trims uniform borders (e.g. Teams/LinkedIn circle-on-gray) then attention-crops to square.
- **Headshot sources:** Prefer rectangular originals or LinkedIn profile photo at full size—not circular Teams thumbnails. Aim for ~800px+ on the short side before upload; re-crop in a photo app if needed. Team page avatars are `rounded-sm` squares; mission PI chips use `rounded-full`.

## Rush Brand System (from Rush Digital Quick Guide)
Official Rush colors with green as primary, defined in globals.css:
- `rush-green` (#006332): Growth Green — official primary brand color
- `rush-dark-green` (#004923): Derived heading shade — actual color used for h1–h3, CTA button backgrounds, active nav (darker for accessibility contrast ~9:1 on warm ivory)
- `rush-teal` (#00A66C): Legacy Green — links, secondary buttons, accents, focus rings
- `rush-emerald` (#5FEEA2): Vitality Green — highlights, badges
- `rush-ivory` (#FFFBEC): Page background (Rush tertiary)
- `rush-sage` (#DFF9EB), `rush-mint` (#E8F8F0): Rush tertiary greens — available as tokens; **do not** use as full-bleed section backgrounds (use `rush-surface-container-low` / `-container` / `-container-high` instead)
- `rush-charcoal` (#0C0C0C): Body text (Rush Black)
- `rush-mid-gray` (#A59F9F): Secondary text (Rush Wash Gray)
- `rush-umber` (#5F5858): Muted text (Rush Raw Umber)
- `rush-light-gray` (#EAEAEA): Borders, cards (Rush Gray)

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT USE)
- No symmetric 3-column icon grids
- No gradient buttons (solid Rush Deep Blue only)
- No centered body text (left-aligned throughout)
- No colored side-borders on cards
- No Cerulean Blue text on light backgrounds

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — local dev server
